# MCP Response Analyzer Skill

**Purpose**: Analyze large MCP tool responses saved to JSON files, filtering and extracting only relevant data to achieve 95-98% token savings.

## Quick Start

### When to Use
- MCP tool response is >5,000 tokens
- Working with list operations: deployments, logs, projects, services
- Need to filter large datasets (e.g., find ERROR deployments among 20 total)

### Basic Workflow

1. **Write MCP response to file**:
   ```bash
   # After calling MCP tool
   cat > /tmp/mcp_deployments_$(date +%Y%m%d).json << 'EOF'
   <paste MCP response>
   EOF
   ```

2. **Filter with Python/jq**:
   ```python
   import json
   with open('/tmp/mcp_deployments.json') as f:
       data = json.load(f)
   errors = [d for d in data['deployments']['deployments'] if d['state'] == 'ERROR']
   print(json.dumps({'results': errors}, indent=2))
   ```

3. **Get compact summary** (300 tokens instead of 10k):
   ```json
   {
     "summary": "Found 2 ERROR deployments out of 20 total",
     "results": [...],
     "token_savings": "~9,800 tokens (97%)"
   }
   ```

## Token Savings

| Scenario | Original | Filtered | Savings |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 20 deployments → 2 ERROR | 10,100 | 300 | **97%** |
| 100 log entries → 5 errors | 25,000 | 400 | **98%** |
| 50 projects → 3 matching | 15,000 | 500 | **97%** |

**Average: 95-98% token reduction**

## Validated MCP Tools

✅ **Vercel**
- `list_deployments` - Filter by state, target, creator
- `list_logs` - Filter by level, text, time range

✅ **Render**
- `list_services` - Filter by type, status
- `list_deploys` - Filter by status, environment
- `list_logs` - Filter by resource, level

✅ **Supabase**
- `list_projects` - Filter by organization, status
- `list_tables` - Filter by schema, size
